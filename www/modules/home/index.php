			Good evening everyone,<br />
			That's it, season 4 is here. No big news this season, but I will still list them to you as usual:<br />
- The India race track appears this season, and the Bahrain circuit is removed. The races schedule of Formula One Manager is now the same as 2011 season of Formula 1.<br />
- The drivers now ask for a salary when you hire them, and you can't change it.<br />
- You can choose your tires during the testing session.<br />
- There are new 'extra soft' tires.<br />
- When you qualify your driver, you must choose the type of tires to put on. Warning: the tires you use to qualify are used for the first relay of the race.<br />
- Aerodynamic optimizations were deleted<br />
- You can now replace in your browser options (tab 'My Account') the 'sliders' by drop-down menus to change the settings of your cars (page 'Race Track -> Strategies')<br />
- The '+' and '-' to choose the number of engineers to be allocated to an aerodynamic element have been replaced by a drop-down menu.<br />
